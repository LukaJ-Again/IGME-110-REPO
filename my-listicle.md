# In Which Marina Lists Off Her Favorite Musical Artists And Gives Recommendations

# Introduction
Good now, whatever time that may be. My name is Marina, and I have a rather peculiar taste in music. It has always 
been rather difficult to properly explain my preferences when it comes to genres and artists - in fact, it has 
always been rather difficult to place things into genres in general. However! That won't stop me from trying. Below
 is a list of assorted favorite artists/albums/songs, loosely grouped into general gists and themes. Don't expect 
 to be able to properly parse things. It's messy.

 ### GHOST

 Formerly known as Ghost And Pals, [GHOST](https://www.youtube.com/@ghostandpals) is a vocaloid producer who is 
 known for their rather eccentric songs and music stylings. One finds it rather difficult to put a genre to his 
 work, but that is for good reason - the music can fluctuate very strongly in tone. A list of my personal top 3 
 songs follows:
 1. [Entomologists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQI5a2WGt2s)
 2. [Appetite of a People-Pleaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf3Err9MvDg)
 3. [TRUST FALL!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhiYG-1fwCQ)
